Facial Recognition for University Course Attendance

Introduction:
This project aims to develop a facial recognition system that can identify if a student belongs to a specific university course and whether they are allowed to attend the lecture or not. The system will use machine learning algorithms to compare the facial features of a student with the pre-registered students of a particular course to determine their course membership and attendance eligibility.
